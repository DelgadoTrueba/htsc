# Meetup Support Material

This guide will help you to get started with the fabric chaincode development. For this tutorial we are going to use a digital ocean droplet, but you can use an environment of your choice. 

First set up your system. For this follow this [guide](../meetup-061020/index.md) including the section: "Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images". 

At this point we have two possibilities to use fabric from the development point of view.

1. [Fabric 2.2 Chaincode Devmode Environment - Binary Edition](fabric2DevMode.md)
2. [Fabric 2.2 Chaincode Devmode Environment - Docker Edition](fabric2DevModeDockerEdition.md)
